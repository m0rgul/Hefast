    <h3>
        Never miss a deadline again!
    </h3>

    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;3DP-OPECR (<span class="hef">Hefast</span>) is a cloud-based application which helps 3D printer
        hubs in better organizing their production activities, estimating and forecasting materials consumption and
        in improving the communication with their clients.
    </p>

    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Due to the flexibility of the system, the hubs can be <b>small</b> (one person with a printer at
        home) or <b>big</b> (a prototyping or rapid manufacturing factory with several machines).
        We very conservatively estimate the total accessible market to be 20.000 3D printers (growing fast!).
    </p>

    <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;While there certainly is competition on the market, we took the best features and added new ones
        to create a more intuitive and easy to use application which innovates also by an additional layer of <b>Big
        Data Analytics</b> and <b>Business Intelligence</b> and the usage of <b><i>FIWARE</i></b> technologies.
